## Porto Taxi Times Project

This project consists on predicting Porto taxi times. 

The repository contains the final model, as well as Jupyter Notebboks with all the code and explanation on it. Since this was the final project for the course CSE151B at UC San Diego,
there is also a midterm report that can be ignored.

The models employed are Linear Regression (benchmark), Fully Connected Neural Network, and XGBoost.

As part of the grading process, a Kaggle competition was created: 

Although our model seemed to perform worse than the rest of competitors on the public data, we are proud to say that we were able to train a general model with no overfitting,
making us scale up to 20 positions in the final ranking in comparison with the rest of collagues.
